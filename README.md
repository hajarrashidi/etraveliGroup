# etraveli Group
A frontend project for Etraveli created by Hajar Rashidi. 
my goal with this project was to show understanding for frontend development.

## [Run demo](https://etraveli.netlify.com/)

### I focused on showing understanding for
- application architecture in Vue
- Simple Unit test with Jest
- Clean Code
- reproducing a website from a sketch
- Working with centralized state management
- Documention, a readme file
- Version Control
- English
- Problem Solving

### What I avoided doing
- Resonsive design, Was not in the instructions but can be solved with media queries. 
- User experience, lack of time & not in the instructions. But acknowledges it as important.
